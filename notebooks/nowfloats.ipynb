    "Pokemons around the world travelling through Hyderabad have never been seen again. They say that the life of a Pokemon around here is hardly a few seconds. This created a serious scare among Pokemons around the world and thus, they called a meeting. In this meeting, it was decided that all the pokemons attack NowFloats University and raze it to the ground. This attack would more affect Hyderabad so to erase every possibility of comeback. The revenge has started. </div>\n"
