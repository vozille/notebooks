    "\n",
    "Each pokemon has a unique fighting style which can be represented using a number, say 12. It means this pokemon when attacked, would throw 12 fireballs at the same time. Based on this unique feature the pokemon war-groups are being created. Each group plans to attack a particular zone in the college.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Students get a bit surprised to see this move from the pokemons. Suddenly there is a pokemon group formations across the college. But the NowFloats university students do not give up. They get together and gather the best pokemon catchers. The engineering students create a unique device called <b>“Fire-Ball Reverse Shield (FBRS)”</b>. A war-group is created even by the students, and each student owns FBRS device which has a unique property say 4. This means the FBRS device would fireback 4 fireballs if you throw one fire-ball at it.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The students send a spy to find some hidden details of the pokemon strategy. And it does work. The spy is able to figure out number of pokemons in each war-group. This information is vital for the students and they start making equal sized groups to attack the pokemons. So a group of 5 pokemons would be attacked by a group of 5 students.\n",
    "We need your help so that we can predict the overall damage that would happen in the university campus assuming the worst case - every student group would fight with every pokemon war-group.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that there are N pokemon war groups. Each war-group has a size of P pokemons. The $i^{th}$ war-group has P pokemons with fighting style index as ${f_1, f_2,...,f_p}$. Here $j^{th}$ pokemon in this group, when attacked would throw $f_j$ fireballs at a time.\n",
    "Also say there are M student groups and each group has P students. The ith student-group has P students with FBRS index as ${s_1,s_2...s_p}$. Here for the $j^{th}$ student in this group, when one fireball is thrown at the FBRS would throwback $s_j$ new fireballs as response.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "When one group of pokemons and one student-group start fighting in a building, one pokemon throws the fireballs at the closest student and the closest student uses the FBRS to fight back only with that pokemon. Since all groups have the same size, so during every group fight one student fights with only one pokemon. <br>\n",

    "Example student group (1,2) attacks pokemon group (5,6). Then the fight happens between 1 and 5 , 2 and 6. Pokemon “5” would throw 5 fireballs at student “1”. Student “1” would throw back 5 fireballs as fight back. Pokemon “6” would throw 6 fireballs at student “2”. Student “2” would throw back 12 fireballs to fight back.
